            <h2 id="purpose">A look at some Top 10 altcoins by market cap.</h2>
            <h3 id="question">What is an altcoin?</h3>
            <p id="definition">An altcoin refers to any cryptocurrency OTHER than Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Binance Coin (BNB) are examples of some popular altcoins currently raking within the top 10 by market cap.</p>

            <p>The green zone indicates a prior level of resistance which has turned into support. This determination has been made based on the shaded boxes. These boxes denote where price approached/entered the green zone and quickly moved away. Between August & September, price moved into the zone but also did not exit and moved on to making a higher high. The last box shows that price has been supported by this zone which means it may be a good time to purchase (other indicators & lower timeframe charts can be used to determine a more precise entry.)</p>

            <p>On a first push, price moved into Zone 3 but quickly broke down. After Zone 2 failed to hold, price moved down to Zone 1. This created a quasi-ascending triangle pattern which is bullish in nature. As price is currently being rejected from Zone 3, we might look for an entry among the confluence of 1) The ascending line + 2) Zone 2 support zone.</p>

            <a id="Binance_chart" href="Binance_Coin_chart"> Full Binance Coin (BNB) Chart</a>
            <p>BNB is in a tough spot in terms of entry and there would be two ways to approach. The first is more aggressive and simply involves starting a position in Zone 1, anticipating that price will continue to move on from there. The more conservative approach involves waiting to see if price tests the diagonal line again, potentially in Zone 1 (or Zone 2). The diagonal line has been tested as support prior to where we are now as depicted in the shaded boxes.</p>
